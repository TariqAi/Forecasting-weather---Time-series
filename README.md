# Forecasting-weather---Time-series
I predict the weather using the prophet algorithm. The advantage of prophet is that it automatically identifies seasonality in the data - and weather data has strong seasonal effects. So without any feature engineering, you can get good baseline accuracy.  I will be able to make predictions for several days or years in advance.
